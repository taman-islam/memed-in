Extension Spec — Meme Profile summary for facebook

# Vision

Turn the visited facebook profile into a meme by,

1. showing a summary box on top of the profile
2. summarizing each post into its honest subtext — with one quiet button.

# Platform

1. Facebook
2. Desktop web
3. Home feed only

# Core interaction (locked)

## UI

1. Show a summary box on top of the profile
2. The box contains:
   A spicy, meme-style summary (Like: I am looking for sex; I need attention; I love fake news, etc)
   A subtle label on top: AI-generated summary.
3. No animations. No popups. No overlays.

## What the “summary” actually is:

1. It’s a social-intent summary. Spicy, meme-style.

Think:

1. “If this person were honest and short, what would they be really saying in their profile summary?”

Tone rules (non-negotiable)

1. Flat
2. Observational
3. Spicy

Never:

1. Use slang
2. Sound angry or political
3. Add facts

Always:

1. Remove hype
2. Make the subtext explicit

Examples (gold standard)

1.  Original: The world is a better place because of you.

Summary: I am looking to get laid.

2.  Original: Today I had to make one of the hardest decisions of my career.

Summary: I need attention.

3.  Original: After mentoring dozens of founders, one thing is clear…

Summary: Give me your attention

4.  Original: I didn’t want to post this, but after so many messages…

Summary: Look! I am happy!!

If it reads like a meme caption in your head — it’s right.
